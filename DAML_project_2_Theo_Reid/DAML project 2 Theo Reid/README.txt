Project2_AEs_LHC(1) is the main python code for this project. 

best_param_search is separate code that I used to perform grid search 
in order to find the optimal hyperparameters for my model.

The best hyperparameters are saved to the best_params pickle file which I
call from my main code to access the optimized hyperparameters.
